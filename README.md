# INTRO

URCC is a simple compiler tool built for LLVM, in Ruby. It parses IR representation that LLVM emits, and add user-defined passes for optimization.

Instead of writing LLVM passes, users could implement and test optimization passes in ruby, which is ideal for algorithm verifications, studying, and teaching.


# INSTALL

Installation requires Ruby Rake installed. If you don't have rake, run following to install.

```
[sudo] gem install rake
```

And then run rake to install:

```
git clone https://github.com/dcompiler/urcc.git
rake install
```


Test if your installation works.

```
urcc --version
```


# QUICK START

## Initialization

For first time run, URCC will add config folder to ```$HOME/.urcc```, and add a config file and a PASSES folder where pass files are defined.

## Compiling C code

Run ```urcc *.c``` to compile C source file. The default outputs includes:

* Un-optimized version of IR;
* Un-optimized version of IR C dump;
* Un-optimized version of compiled binary;
* Optimized version of IR;
* Optimized version of IR C dump;
* Optimized version of compiled binary;

The output could be defined in config file.

## Adding your own passes

By default, passes are contained in ```$HOME/.urcc/PASSES```, and are defined individually as ruby files. Edit the config file if you want to include your pass file names in PASS > passes, separated by commas.

A pass should be defined as a ruby Proc named 'Pass', inside a module named 'PassModule'. The 'Pass' Proc takes the AST tree of the program as input.

Following is an example pass which does nothing.

```ruby
# Define a HelloWorld pass                                                                                                              
module PassModule

  Pass = Proc.new do |prog|

    p prog

  end

end
```

To include this pass, save it as "HelloWorld.rb" under PASSES directory, and add HelloWorld to config file PASSES > passes.
